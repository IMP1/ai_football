# FIFAI Faux-Fun

FIFAI Faux-Fun is a football management game, where you control how the players
behave.

Programme your players' behaviour using the lua programming language, and watch
as they seamlessly come together, their teamwork mirroring the elegance found in
the eternal balet that is the beautiful game.

## API Documentation

At some point, if this takes off, I'll write up the documentation for the API 
onto a wiki, and link to it from here. In the mean time, I'm focussing on the
development of the game, and those of you who are more comfortable with lua code
can find the relevant bits for the AI API to be in the `cls_api.lua` file.

## About

I came across a game called [Screeps](https://screeps.com) and I thought it was 
a fantastic idea. My mind immediately started coming up with ideas for games 
that used user-coded AI in a similar way. FIFAI Faux-Fun was the idea that stuck
with me the most.

It's name is horrendously silly, and I love it. FIFAI is a portmanteau of FIFA,
the [International Federation of Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA), 
and AI. It's a portmanteau of acronyms, which made me come up with another two
portmanteaus: portmantonym or acromanteau. And Faux-Fun is a description of the
idea, really, as you're just watching your creation work (or not), rather than
playing the game yourself. And together it (almost) makes the poem of the giant
from Jack and the Beanstalk: [Fe Fi Fo Fum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee-fi-fo-fum).

## Screenshots

I'm not very good at making things look good, but when I do, this is where I 
will show it off to the world.
